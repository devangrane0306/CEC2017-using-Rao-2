    Rao-3 (Rao algorithm 3) metaheuristic optimization algorithm.
    
    This implementation adheres strictly to Function Evaluation (FES) 
    termination criteria to comply with official benchmark constraints.
    Fitness values are cached locally to ensure a 1:1 FES-to-evaluation ratio 
    and prevent computational redundancy.

    Rao-3 extends Rao-2 by adding a third perturbation term based on the
    interaction between the current solution and a second randomly selected
    partner solution, in addition to the best-worst directional term and
    the first partner interaction term from Rao-2.

    Update equation:
        x_new = x + r1*(best - worst) + r2*(|xi - xk| or |xk - xi|)
                  + r3*(|xi - xl| or |xl - xi|)
    where xk and xl are two distinct randomly selected partner solutions.
